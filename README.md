# wtf-bf

This is a small side project written in [Brainfuck](https://brainfuck.org/) – a
minimalist, esoteric programming language made up of just eight commands. While
Brainfuck is Turing-complete, it's mostly used for puzzles, experimentation, and
brain-twisting fun rather than practical applications.

I used it here purely for the challenge and enjoyment – as a creative exercise
to output the sentence that had been a brainfuck for me for years.

```bash
$ brew install brainfuck
$ brainfuck wtf.bf
```
